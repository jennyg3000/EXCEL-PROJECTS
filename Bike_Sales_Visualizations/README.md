## ⚙️ Core Excel Functions Explained 🧮

The analysis and creation of the summary sheets were heavily reliant on the following Excel functions for data manipulation and aggregation:

### 1. `SUMIFS` / `AVERAGEIFS` for Conditional Aggregation 🎯
These functions are essential for calculating totals or averages based on **multiple criteria**.

* **Explanation:** Sums or averages values in a range that meet **multiple criteria** specified in separate ranges. This is the non-PivotTable method for summarizing data by dimension (e.g., country, product). 📏
* **Example Usage:** Used to calculate **Total Revenue** for a specific product in a given year.
    * `=SUMIFS(Revenue_Column, Year_Column, 2021, Category_Column, "Bikes")`

### 2. `IFS` for Logic and Classification 🧠
This function allows for clean, multi-condition logic, crucial for segmenting customers.

* **Explanation:** Checks **multiple logical tests** in sequence and returns the value corresponding to the **first test that is TRUE**. It is superior to nested `IF` statements.
* **Example Usage:** Used to categorize customers into age groups (`Youth`, `Adults`, `Seniors`) from the raw `Customer_Age` column. 🧑‍🦳

### 3. `TEXT` and `CONCATENATE` for Data Preparation 🔗
These functions ensure that data is properly formatted for consistent reporting.

* **`TEXT`:** Converts a numeric value (like a date) to a text string in a specified number format.
    * **Example Usage:** Used to extract a consistent `YYYY` format from the date column for annual analysis. 📅
* **`CONCATENATE` / `&` Operator:** Joins two or more text strings.
    * **Example Usage:** Used to combine `Product Category` and `Sub-Category` into a single reporting label. 🏷️

## 📊 Detailed Sheet Analysis 📋

### Sheet 1: Sales Data (Raw Transactional Data) 🧾

This sheet contains the full, raw, transaction-level data used as the source for all analysis.

* **Content:** Includes columns for `Date`, `Customer_Age`, `Age_Group` (a calculated column), `Country`, `State`, `Product_Category`, `Revenue`, and `Profit`.
* **Key Role:** This sheet is where the **`IFS`** and **`TEXT`** functions are first applied to clean and transform the data before aggregation. ⚙️

---

### Sheet 2: Revenue and Profit by Year (Time Series Analysis) 📈

This sheet aggregates the raw transaction data to show overall annual performance trends.

* **Key Function Used:** **`SUMIFS`** (Used to total Profit and Revenue columns, with `Year` as the criteria).
* **Table Snapshot (Summarized Data):**

| Year | Annual Profit | Annual Revenue |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2017 | \$4,065,680 | \$10,289,670 |
| 2019 | \$7,417,353 | \$15,705,990 |
| 2021 | \$12,986,202 | \$29,747,226 |

* **Visualization:** **Revenue and Profit Trend** 📉

    * *Insight:* The chart helps visualize the **year-over-year growth** 🚀 and identify periods of stagnation (e.g., the dip in 2019).

### Sheet 3: Revenue by Age Group (Customer Segmentation) 👥

This sheet is crucial for customer segmentation, identifying which demographic drives the most revenue using `IFS` logic to categorize customers.

* **Key Function Used:** **`IFS`** (Used to create the **Age\_Group** classification) and **PivotTable Aggregation**.
* **Table Snapshot (Summarized Data):**

| Age Group | Sum of Revenue |
| :---: | :---: |
| Adults (35-64) | \$47,323,876 |
| Young Adults (25-34) | \$34,310,905 |
| Youth (<25) | \$13,201,837 |
| Seniors (64+) | \$339,700 |

* **Visualization:** **Revenue by Age Group Chart** 🥇

    * *Insight:* The bar chart confirms that the **Adults (35-64)** segment is the most valuable and should be prioritized. ⭐

### Sheet 4: Product Revenue by Country (Geographic and Product Analysis) 🗺️📦

This sheet uses a two-dimensional PivotTable structure to analyze both geographic performance and product category success simultaneously.

* **Key Function Used:** Driven primarily by **PivotTable Row and Column fields** using the raw data.
* **Table Snapshot (Top Countries):**

| Country | Accessories Revenue | Bikes Revenue | Clothing Revenue | Total Revenue |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| United States | \$5.8M | \$21.5M | \$3.4M | \$30.8M |
| Australia | \$3.3M | \$20.2M | \$1.9M | \$25.4M |
| United Kingdom | \$1.9M | \$8.1M | \$0.9M | \$11.1M |
| Germany | \$1.7M | \$7.5M | \$0.7M | \$9.9M |
