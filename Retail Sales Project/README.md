# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis & Excel Function Portfolio

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains the `retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx` Excel workbook. This project demonstrates proficiency in **data handling, complex calculations, aggregation (Pivot Tables), and data visualization** using a large retail sales transactional dataset.

***

## ⚙️ Excel Functions Explained

The following core Excel functions are used throughout the workbook:

| Function | Category | Purpose | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SUM** | Math/Trig | Calculates the total sum of a range of cells. | Implicitly used in Pivot Tables to total `Total Sales`. |
| **AVERAGE** | Statistical | Calculates the arithmetic mean of numbers. | Used in **Day 2 Task 2** to find the average student score. |
| **MAX** | Statistical | Returns the largest number in a set of values. | Used in **Day 2 Task 2** to find a student's `Highest score`. |
| **IF** | Logical | Checks whether a condition is met and returns one value if TRUE, and another value if FALSE. | Can be used in **retail\_sales\_dataset** to categorize commissions based on a sales threshold (e.g., `=IF(Sales>1000, "High", "Low")`). *This is an assumed logical use.* |
| **CONCATENATE / `&`** | Text | Joins several text strings or cell values into one text string. | Used in the **Transactions** sheet to combine `Total Sales` and `Product Category`. |
| **Multiplication (`*`)** | Math | Performs multiplication between two values. | Used in **retail\_sales\_dataset** to calculate `Total Sales` (`Quantity * Price`). |

## 📂 Sheet-by-Sheet Breakdown

### 1. Sheet: `retail_sales_dataset` (Master Data & Calculations)

This is the primary data source containing every transaction record and initial calculated fields.

* **📋 Table:** **Raw Transaction Data Table** including columns for `Transaction ID`, date components, customer demographics (`Gender`, `Age`, `Generation`), product details, and calculated columns for `Total Sales` and `Commission`.
* **📉 Charts & Visualizations:**
    * **Line Chart:** Recommended for plotting **Total Sales** against the `Date` column to visualize sales trends, growth, and seasonality.
* **🧮 Functions Highlighted:** **`*` (Multiplication)** and potentially **`IF`** for conditional commission calculation.

### 2. Sheet: `Sheet1` (Sales Distribution Analysis)

This sheet uses a Pivot Table to analyze the proportional contribution of sales from various demographic groups.

* **📋 Table:** **Pivot Table** structured with `Product Category` in rows and nested `Gender`/`Generation` in columns.
    * **Key Feature:** The values are displayed as a **Percentage of Grand Total**, showing proportional sales distribution.
* **📊 Charts & Visualizations:**
    * **100% Stacked Column Chart:** Ideal for visualizing how different segments (`Gender` and `Generation`) contribute to the total percentage of sales within each `Product Category`. 
* **🧮 Functions Highlighted:** **`SUM`** (implicit in Pivot Table) and **Pivot Table "Show Values As" (% of Grand Total)** feature.

---

### 3. Sheet: `Sheet2` (Filtered Segment Analysis)

This sheet contains a Pivot Table focused on absolute sales figures for a specific, filtered customer segment (likely the **Adult** generation).

* **📋 Table:** **Pivot Table** with `Product Category` in rows and `Gender` in columns.
    * **Filter:** The table is filtered to a single value in the `Generation` field.
    * **Values Display:** The `Sum of Total Sales` is shown as **absolute currency values**.
* **📊 Charts & Visualizations:**
    * **Clustered Bar Chart:** Best for a direct, side-by-side comparison of the absolute revenue generated by **Male** versus **Female** customers within the selected `Product Category`.
* **🧮 Functions Highlighted:** **`SUM`** (implicit in Pivot Table) and **Pivot Table Filtering**.

---

### 4. Sheet: `Transactions` (Data Manipulation)

A technical sheet used to demonstrate how text and numerical data can be combined into a single field.

* **📋 Table:** A table with source columns (`Total Sales`, `Product category`) and a target column (`Concatenate`) showing the combined output.
* **❌ Charts & Visualizations:** None required.
* **🧮 Excel Functions Used:**
    * **CONCATENATE / `&` (Ampersand Operator):** Used to merge text and numeric values to create a combined identifier or descriptive label.

---

### 5. Sheet: `Day 2 Task 2` (Student Performance)

A separate dataset demonstrating basic statistical and data ranking capabilities.

* **📋 Table:** A **Student Gradebook** table listing names, subject scores (`English`, `Mathematics`, `Science`), and two calculated metrics: `Average` score and `Highest score`.
* **📊 Charts & Visualizations:**
    * **Radar Chart:** Effective for showing a student's performance profile across the three subjects, allowing visual identification of a student's strongest and weakest areas.
* **🧮 Excel Functions Used:**
    * **AVERAGE:** Calculates the mean score across subjects for each student.
    * **MAX:** Finds the single highest score among a student's subjects.
    * **Filter & Sort:** Used to rank students by individual subject score or overall `Average`.
